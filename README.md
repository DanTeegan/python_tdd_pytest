## What is TDD - Test driven development
## Why we need it? - test our code before pushing it to production
## We use pytest and unit test modules in python to test our code.

```bash
important points

test file MUST INCLUDE KEY WORD TEST
calc_test

```
 ### Fail, pass, refactor
 
 ##### When running a pytest use the following syntax in the terminal
 ```python
python -m pytest
```
